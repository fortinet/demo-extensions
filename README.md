# FortiDemo Inspector
## Description
  A Terraform script to demonstrate AWS Inspector with FortiGate.

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) 0.12
* An [AWS access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey)
* FortiOS 6.4.4
* Environment with **expect** tool support https://core.tcl-lang.org/expect/index


## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:
   - A VPC with two subnets, one private, one public
   - An Internet gateway
   - A NAT gateway
   - An Ubuntu instance in the private subnet
   - A FortiGate PAYG instance with two NICs, one in each subnet
   - An S3 bucket, to store the config files
   - A security group with no restrictions
   - An AWS Inspector template and targets

## Deployment
> **Note:** By default the script expects an ssh key at ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

> **Note:IPV6** The FortiGate cloud-init data expects an ipv4 address to be added to the trusthost. If you are using ipv6 you will need to adjust the trusthost under config_script set ipv4-trusthost to set ipv6-trusthost
To deploy the FortiDemo Inspector:

  1. Clone the repository.
  2. Change to the cloned directory and initialize the providers and modules:

     ```sh
     $ cd fortidemo-inspector
     $ terraform init
     ```

  3. Submit the Terraform plan using the command below. Replace the variables with your own AccessKey and Secret Key.

     ```sh
     $ terraform plan -var "access_key=<access_key>" -var "secret_key=<secret_key>" -var "fortidemo_ip=<ip_address>"
     ```

  4. Verify output.
  5. Confirm and apply the plan:

     ```sh
     $ terraform apply -var "access_key=<access_key>" -var "secret_key=<secret_key>" -var "fortidemo_ip=<ip_address>"
     ```

  6. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

## Destroy the cluster
To destroy the cluster, use the command:

```sh
$ terraform destroy -var "access_key=<access_key>" -var "secret_key=<secret_key>"
```

## Additional information
The region is hard-coded to `us-west-1`. If the region is changed, the inspector rules must also be changed under `rules_package_arns` in ` "aws_inspector_assessment_template" "inspector_template"`.
Inspector rule ARNs can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/userguide/inspector_rules-arns.html).
